Because so many people are losing their hands or legs owing to various causes such as accidents, surgeries, etc., "amputated persons" is the most widely heard word these days. We focused on a group of people who had their hands amputated and learned about their issues in everyday life, such as holding objects, making nonverbal gestures, writing, and so on. We've taken on two half-finished projects, one of which predicts our actions based on brain signal frequencies and the other of which is a bionic arm controlled by an electromagnetic band. We considered connecting the EEG data from the brain sensor to the bionic arm so that the arm could respond to the brain impulses and act accordingly.

### **Specific Contribution💪**

• Developed Machine Learning Algorithm for classifying the actions based on data acquired from the Node-Red using Emotiv Insight Sensor
• Sending data from Node-Red to the microcontroller wirelessly and actuating the bionic arm
• Obtained EEG frequency values using Node-RED and sensor

### **Specific Learning👨‍🎓**
• Learnt the basic operation of the software Node-RED Toolbox
• Learnt about basic usage of python programming language in developing an efficient machine learning algorithm
• Programming a microcontroller to receive the data from Node-RED wirelessly

### **Technical Limitations & Ethical Challenges faced ⛓**
• Machine learning model used to give wring predictions due to data insufficiency
• Bluetooth mode of data transfer from Node-RED to microcontroller haven’t worked due to improper functionality of Bluetooth node in Node-RED
• Emotiv Insight used to get disconnected frequently
