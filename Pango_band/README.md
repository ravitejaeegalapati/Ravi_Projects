## **Problem Statement :**

2020 is clearly not the year humanity can be very proud of. All hell broke lose since the beginning and even though we have a lot to worry about as of now, *COVID-19* is clearly the elephant in the room. We haven't cracked the 'code' on this one ( A little techie touch :)). YET! So in this case, prevention is literally better than cure. ( *If you think about it, a mask ain't that bad compared to a ventilator down your throat 🤷‍♀️*). Some of the measures we can take are as follows:

- Staying at home.*(Duh.*)
- Washing hands with alcohol-based soap or hand wash regularly. (*Now that's some solid advice. Looking at you hostelers😕*)
- Maintaining distance from others. (*We are engineers, so....*)
- Covering face with a mask or a cloth.

We are frequently emphasized to keep a minimum distance of 1.5 m between people and *sanitize hands* frequently and keep a regular check on our health conditions.

*Social distancing* matters a lot now as lock down has been lifted officially. Returning back to normalcy is as necessary as the cure. So we have to stay apart to do our part but people are not following that (*Not very cool of you people😐*) and they tend to forget the actual situation we are in. Washing hands regularly or sanitizing hands for every 30 minutes is clearly mandatory in this  time of crisis . But, we don't remember to do this in our daily schedules (*Not blaming or judging anyone, we all forget stuff😁*).

So, a device that always alerts you and *keeps you in track of your health condition* can come in handy. This is very essential to tackle the present situation smartly. **drum rolls* * Introducing Pango, our smart and simple solution to the existing crisis. **drum roll ends** 

## **Real time usage :**

This  **PANGO** band makes things simple for us by alerting us precisely. It reminds us to wash or sanitize our hands for every 30 mins through a buzzer alert. It alerts us to maintain distance from other person when we go close to the person by blinking red led ( *Now that's the cool stuff😎*). It notifies us about our body temperature. If it gets greater than normal body temperature (37.5℃ or 99.5℉) it enlightens a led so that we can take proper medication ( *In short, it knows how hot you are 😉* ). It's simple. It's Portable . It's user friendly . It's **Pango**.
